2. Input data has 11 events. This is the brief description of what happens:
	- The first 10 events cover 10 different areas
	- The last event (11th) happens after > 30min of the 10th event. So all the previous 10 events will leave the sliding window

3. The output file has 20 lines. This is the brief description of what happens:
	- The first 10 lines is trivial -> a new area will be considered in each new output line, as a taxi leaves from the new area
	- In the next 10 lines, a new area will be removed in each new output line, as the sliding window crosses this area

4. raw_input_1 : tests 
	a) if median calculated properly 
	b) empty taxis doesn't include taxis which have a takeoff after their last dropoff
	c) if 30min sliding window working properly

4. raw_input_2 : tests 
	a) if median calculated properly 
	b) both 30min and 15min sliding window working properly
