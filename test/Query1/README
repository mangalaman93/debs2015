1. I have used 6 areas as shown below. These give me 6C2 routes which is > 10, and thus helping us cover all the cases.

2. Input data has 13 events. This is the brief description of what happens:
	- The first 10 events cover 10 different routes (R1-R10)
	- The next 2 events cover the 11th route, R11
	- The last event (13th) happens after > 30min of the 12th event. So all the previous 12 events will leave the sliding window

3. The output file has 23 lines. This is the brief description of what happens:
	- The first 10 lines is trivial, corresponding to the first 10 events
	- Lines 11-12 put corresponds to 11th and 12th events in the input file
	- Lines 13-22, each of the events remove from the sliding window one by one
	- Last line (23) corresponds to the 13th event
